# cube_checks.py

This file contains checks I use for validating the cube configuration string.

- has the cube string a length of 54
- has the cube exact 6 colors
- is each color on exactly 9 facelets
- is the cube solved

Since the modules of my solution give back configuration files for the next module it makes sense to prove the cube configuration for validity
