# H.O.R.S.T.

When I was a teenager, we often had parties in my uncle's basement bar. He found it fascinating how I could solve Rubik's Cube in two minutes (and 7 seconds). My uncle passed away much too early and left me his house. Today I stood behind the bar in the cellar, opened a bottle of red wine and thought about a name for my project. My uncle's name was Horst. That's what I want the name of the project to be: Hardware Oriented Rubik Solving Tool (H.O.R.S.T.). Cheers, Horst. May you look down on us from your cloud.
